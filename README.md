# Open M3U8 (working name)

## Description

This is an open source M3U8 playlist parser and writer java library that attempts to conform to this specification:

http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-16

Currently the functionality is more than sufficient for our needs. However, there is still a lot of work to be done before we have full compliance. Pull requests are welcome!

## Rationale

We would like to give back to the open source community surrounding Android that has helped make iHeartRadio a success. By using the MIT license we hope to make this code as usable as possible.

## Artifacts

We now have artifacts in Maven Central! Artifacts are typically built with Java 7.

### Gradle

```
dependencies {
  compile 'com.iheartradio.m3u8:open-m3u8:0.2.4'
}
```

### Maven

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.iheartradio.m3u8</groupId>
  <artifactId>open-m3u8</artifactId>
  <version>0.2.4</version>
</dependency>
```

## Getting started

Important: The public API is still volatile. It will remain subject to frequent change until a 1.0.0 release is made.

Getting started with parsing is quite easy: Get a `PlaylistParser` and specify the format.

```java
InputStream inputStream = ...
PlaylistParser parser = new PlaylistParser(inputStream, Format.EXT_M3U, Encoding.UTF_8);
Playlist playlist = parser.parse();
```

Creating a new `Playlist` works via `Builder`s and their fluent `with*()` methods. On each `build()` method the provided parameters are validated:

```java
TrackData trackData = new TrackData.Builder()
    .withTrackInfo(new TrackInfo(3.0f, "Example Song"))
    .withPath("example.mp3")
    .build();

List<TrackData> tracks = new ArrayList<TrackData>();
tracks.add(trackData);

MediaPlaylist mediaPlaylist = new MediaPlaylist.Builder()
    .withMediaSequenceNumber(1)
    .withTargetDuration(3)
    .withTracks(tracks)
    .build();

Playlist playlist = new Playlist.Builder()
    .withCompatibilityVersion(5)
    .withMediaPlaylist(mediaPlaylist)
    .build();
```

The Playlist is similar to a C style union of a `MasterPlaylist` and `MediaPlaylist` in that it has one or the other but not both. You can check with `Playlist.hasMasterPlaylist()` or `Playlist.hasMediaPlaylist()` which type you got.

Modifying an existing `Playlist` works similar to creating via the `Builder`s. Also, each data class provides a `buildUpon()` method to generate a new `Builder` with all the data from the object itself:

```java
TrackData additionalTrack = new TrackData.Builder()
    .withTrackInfo(new TrackInfo(3.0f, "Additional Song"))
    .withPath("additional.mp3")
    .build();

List<TrackData> updatedTracks = new ArrayList<TrackData>(playlist.getMediaPlaylist().getTracks());
updatedTracks.add(additionalTrack);

MediaPlaylist updatedMediaPlaylist = playlist.getMediaPlaylist()
    .buildUpon()
    .withTracks(updatedTracks)
    .build();

Playlist updatedPlaylist = playlist.buildUpon()
    .withMediaPlaylist(updatedMediaPlaylist)
    .build();
```

A `PlaylistWriter` can be obtained directly or via its builder.

```java
OutputStream outputStream = ...

PlaylistWriter writer = new PlaylistWriter(outputStream, Format.EXT_M3U, Encoding.UTF_8);
writer.write(updatedPlaylist);

writer = new PlaylistWriter.Builder()
                 .withOutputStream(outputStream)
                 .withFormat(Format.EXT_M3U)
                 .withEncoding(Encoding.UTF_8)
                 .build();

writer.write(updatedPlaylist);
```

causing this playlist to be written:

```
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-VERSION:5
#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:3
#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE:1
#EXTINF:3.0,Example Song
example.mp3
#EXTINF:3.0,Additional Song
additional.mp3
#EXT-X-ENDLIST
```

Currently, writing multiple playlists with the same writer is not supported.

## Advanced usage

### Parsing mode

The parser supports a mode configuration - by default it operats in a `strict` mode which attemps to adhere to the specification as much as possible.

Providing the parser a `ParsingMode` you can relax some of the requirements. Two parsing modes are made available, or you can build your own custom mode.
```java
ParsingMode.LENIENT // lenient about everything
ParsingMode.STRICT // strict about everything
```
Example:
```java
InputStream inputStream = ...
PlaylistParser parser = new PlaylistParser(inputStream, Format.EXT_M3U, Encoding.UTF_8, ParsingMode.LENIENT);
Playlist playlist = parser.parse();
if (playlist.hasMasterPlaylist() && playlist.getMasterPlaylist().hasUnknownTags()) {
    System.err.println(
        playlist.getMasterPlaylist().getUnknownTags());
} else if (playlist.hasMediaPlaylist() && playlist.getMediaPlaylist().hasUnknownTags()) {
    System.err.println(
        playlist.getMediaPlaylist().getUnknownTags());
} else {
    System.out.println("Parsing without unknown tags successful");
}
```
